<p> I am an industrial organization economist. I study how firms behave under uncertainty about market conditions:
	how they <b>reduce</b> uncertainty, how they <b>adapt</b> to uncertainty they cannot reduce, how informational asymmetries between
	firms impacts <b>competition</b>, and how economists can <b>infer</b> firms' information from market data.</p>
